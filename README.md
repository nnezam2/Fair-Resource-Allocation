# Fair-Resource-Allocation
Fair Resource Allocation is an academic project which aims at incorporating "Fairness" components in to an allocation model. During the development
of this work, the COVID-19 pandemic is still spreading in U.S. and all ove the world and most countires seek to find a vaccine or treatment. While many poor communities and minority groups have been shown to be much more vulnerable than others, fairness in vaccine allocation should be a necessity.
In this work we integrate different aspects of resource allocation and seek a synergistic strategy in which the vulnerable populations would be vaccinated with higher priority. We propose a trade-off between geographical coverage and social group fairness as a guiding principle for prevention-centered strategies. The
proposed methodology can also be applied to other scarce resources and social benefit allocation problems.
